# 📈 Retail Sales Forecasting using ARIMA & SARIMA

🧠 Project Overview

This project builds an end-to-end time series forecasting system to predict weekly retail company sales using statistical models.

The objective is to transform raw historical sales data into a forecasting model that supports demand planning and inventory decisions.

We compare ARIMA vs SARIMA and evaluate model accuracy on unseen future data.

🎯 Business Problem

Retail sales show:

Weekly fluctuations

Holiday demand spikes

Yearly seasonal patterns

The goal is to answer:

“How much will we sell in upcoming weeks?”

Accurate forecasting helps with:

✔ Inventory planning
✔ Staffing decisions
✔ Supply chain optimization
